Alteryx COVID 19 Extractor Workflow

Johns Hopkins University has been uploading Worldwide COVID Figures CSV files daily.

The data from the files will be loaded from GIT, blended and extracted to Excel, QVX and Tableau Extracts. The Workflow file that extracts the data from the URL and the Macro File that does the pre-processing of data has been attached.
